# 🎓 Webinar – Student-Focused Event Discovery Platform

Webinar is a **frontend website** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that helps students discover **relevant webinars, tech conferences, and insightful events** near their location.

The idea behind this project is to create a **student-friendly alternative** to platforms like Meetup, AllEvents, and Konfhub, where learning and upskilling events are often buried under too many unrelated listings.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Existing event platforms:
- Are overcrowded with mixed and unrelated events
- Lack a dedicated space for **students**
- Make it difficult to discover **learning-focused webinars**

Webinar aims to solve this by:
- Highlighting **educational & tech events**
- Helping students upskill through curated webinars
- Helping event hosts reach the **right audience**
- Sending follow-up emails to registered users (future scope)
